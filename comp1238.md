## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
- 
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes

## Key Concepts  
   
### Binary System  
- **Bit**: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).  
- **Byte**: Group of 8 bits.  
- **Binary Numbers**: Numbers represented using base 2.  
   
### Memory Types  
- **Volatile Memory**: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).  
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).  
   
### Number Representation  
- **Unsigned Numbers**: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.  
- **Signed Numbers**: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.  
- **Fractional Numbers**: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.

### Text Representation  
- **ASCII Table**: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').  
- **Control Codes**: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).  
   
### File Types  
- **Text Files**: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.  
- **Binary Files**: Not intended to be read as text.  
   
## Historical Context  
- **Morse Code**: Early binary communication using short and long beeps.  
- **Punch Cards**: Early data storage method using holes to represent bits.  
- **Teleprinters**: Early devices for sending typed messages over long distances.  
   
## Additional Topics  
   
### Number Systems  
- **Decimal (Base 10)**: Standard human number system.  
- **Binary (Base 2)**: Used in computing.  
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.

### Memory and Storage  
- **RAM**: Fast, volatile memory for active processes.  
- **Storage Devices**: Include SSDs and HDDs, used for long-term data storage.  
   
## Practical Applications  
- **Text Editors**: Display bytes as characters using ASCII.  
- **File Structure**: Files are sequences of bytes, organized in directories.  
   
## Study Tips  
- Understand the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.  
- Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.  
- Familiarize yourself with ASCII and its role in text representation.  
- Explore how files are structured and the difference between text and binary files.

## Week 3 - Structure of Text
## Text Structure  
- **Historical Context**:   
  - Early text structures in printing and typewriting.  
  - Example: Ancient texts with commentary.  
- **Modern Examples**:  
  - Newspapers, ledgers, and digital formats like JSON.
    
## Markup Languages  
- **Markdown**:  
  - Simple syntax for formatting.  
  - Titles: `# Title`, `## Subtitle`  
  - Italic: `_italic_`  
  - Bold: `**bold**`  
  - Lists: `* item` or `- item`  
  - Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.  

- **HTML**:  
  - More verbose than Markdown.  
  - Tags: `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` 

## Special Characters and Escaping  
- **Special Characters**:  
  - Non-alphanumeric symbols like `@`, `#`, `$`, `&`, `*`.  
  - Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.  
  - Example: `\#` to display `#` in Markdown.  

- **HTML Escaping**:  
  - Use `&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`, `&amp;` for `&`.  

## Structured Data  
- **JSON**:  
  - Format: `{"key": "value"}`  
  - Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.  
    
- **XML**:  
  - Similar to HTML, used for data representation.  
  - Tags: `<tag>value</tag>`  

## Study Tipsâœ¨  
- Familiarize with Markdown and HTML syntax.  
- Practice using escape characters in different contexts.  
- Explore GitHub for hands-on experience with repositories and Markdown files.

## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors

## Keyboard Mastery  
- **Importance**: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.  
- **Types**:  
  - Standard 104-key layout.  
  - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.  
- **Layouts**:  
  - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.  
- **Modifier Keys**: modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
- **Touch Typing**: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.  

## Text Editors  
- **Types**:  
  - Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).  
- **Popular Editors**:  
  - **Vim**: Command-line based, requires learning commands.  
    - Exit command: `:q!`  
  - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Widely used, feature-rich.  
    - Extensions and themes available.  
- **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.  

## Search Techniques  
- **Basic Search**: Use `Ctrl + F` for finding text.  
- **Advanced Search**:  
  - **Wildcards**: Use `*` for any character sequence.  
  - **Regex (Regular Expressions)**: For pattern matching.  
    - Example: `line\d+` finds "line" followed by digits. 

## Week 5 - CLI

### Modern CLI Usage  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.  
  - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.  
  - Easier automation through scripting.  
  - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.  
  - Minimal resource usage on computers.  

### Basic CLI Commands  
- **Navigation and File Management**:  
  - `ls`: List files in a directory.  
  - `cd`: Change directory.  
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.  
  - `cat`: Display file contents.  
  - `less`: View file contents interactively.  
  - `cp`: Copy files.  
  - `mv`: Move files.  
  - `mkdir`: Create a directory.  
  - `ping`: Test network connectivity.  

- **Advanced Commands**:  
  - `grep`: Search text using patterns.  
  - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.  

### Remote Access and Security  
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**:  
  - Connect to remote computers securely.  
  - Allows command line access to remote systems. 

-Connect to remote computers securely.
-Allows command line access to remote systems.

- **File Transfer**:  
  - `scp`: Securely copy files between computers.
