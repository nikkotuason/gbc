## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
- 
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).
- Byte: Group of 8 bits.
- Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2.
**Memory Type:**
- Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
- Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).
**Number Representation:**
-Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
-Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
-Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.
**Text Represenation:**
- ASCII Table: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
- Control Codes: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).
**File Type:**
- Text Files: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
- Binary Files: Not intended to be read as text.

## Study Tips ✨

- Understand the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.
- Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
- Familiarize yourself with ASCII and its role in text representation.
- Explore how files are structured and the difference between text and binary files.

## Week 3 - Structure of Text
**Markup Languages**
- Simple syntax for formatting.
- Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
- Italic: _italic_
- Bold: **bold**
- Lists: * item or - item
- Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.

**HTML**
- More verbose than Markdown.
- Tags: <ul>, <li>, <p>, <strong>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>

**Special Characters:**

-Non-alphanumeric symbols like @, #, $, &, *.
-Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.
-Example: \# to display # in Markdown.

**HTML Escaping:**
-Use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, &amp; for &.

**JSON:**

-Format: {"key": "value"}
-Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.

**XML:**

-Similar to HTML, used for data representation.
-Tags: <tag>value</tag>

## Study Tips:✨

-Familiarize with Markdown and HTML syntax.
-Practice using escape characters in different contexts.
-Explore GitHub for hands-on experience with repositories and Markdown files.

## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors

## Keyboard Mastery  
- **Importance**: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.  
- **Types**:  
  - Standard 104-key layout.  
  - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.  
- **Layouts**:  
  - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.  
- **Modifier Keys**: modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
- **Touch Typing**: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.  

## Text Editors  
- **Types**:  
  - Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).  
- **Popular Editors**:  
  - **Vim**: Command-line based, requires learning commands.  
    - Exit command: `:q!`  
  - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Widely used, feature-rich.  
    - Extensions and themes available.  
- **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.  

## Search Techniques  
- **Basic Search**: Use `Ctrl + F` for finding text.  
- **Advanced Search**:  
  - **Wildcards**: Use `*` for any character sequence.  
  - **Regex (Regular Expressions)**: For pattern matching.  
    - Example: `line\d+` finds "line" followed by digits. 

## Week 5 - CLI

### Modern CLI Usage  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.  
  - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.  
  - Easier automation through scripting.  
  - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.  
  - Minimal resource usage on computers.  

### Basic CLI Commands  
- **Navigation and File Management**:  
  - `ls`: List files in a directory.  
  - `cd`: Change directory.  
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.  
  - `cat`: Display file contents.  
  - `less`: View file contents interactively.  
  - `cp`: Copy files.  
  - `mv`: Move files.  
  - `mkdir`: Create a directory.  
  - `ping`: Test network connectivity.  

- **Advanced Commands**:  
  - `grep`: Search text using patterns.  
  - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.  

### Remote Access and Security  
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**:  
  - Connect to remote computers securely.  
  - Allows command line access to remote systems. 

-Connect to remote computers securely.
-Allows command line access to remote systems.

- **File Transfer**:  
  - `scp`: Securely copy files between computers.  
  - `sftp`: Secure file transfer protocol.
